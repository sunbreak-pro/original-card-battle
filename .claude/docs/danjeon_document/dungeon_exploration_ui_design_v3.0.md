## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Concept

**"The Descent"** - Expression of psychological pressure via an hourglass-shaped map.

- **Visual experience of being cornered:** The deeper you dive, the narrower the path becomes, creating mental pressure.
- **Strategic judgment:** The **Lives System** creates tension - death has real consequences, forcing careful risk assessment.
- **Tension of return:** The risk of returning creates a tense decision on "when to turn back."

### 1.2 Terminology Definition

| Term        | Definition                         | Notes                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Node / Room | A single point on the map          | Used interchangeably                 |
| Depth       | Dungeon layer (1-5)                | Also referred to as "Shindo" (Depth) |
| Exploration | From dungeon entry to return/death | No limit on exploration count        |
| Lives       | Recovery chances after death       | Difficulty-based cap                 |

### 1.3 Lives System (残機システム)

| Element               | Specification                                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lives Cap (Hard)      | **2 Lives**                                                          |
| Lives Cap (Normal/Easy)| **3 Lives**                                                         |
| Decrease Timing       | **Death only** (Does NOT decrease on successful return)              |
| Recovery Method       | **None** (No means of recovery exists)                               |
| Reaching 0 Lives      | **Game Over** (Complete reset, only achievements persist)            |
| UI Position           | Header Top-Right (Heart icons: ❤️❤️❤️ or ❤️❤️)                      |

**Strategic Significance:**

- Players can explore unlimited times as long as they have lives remaining.
- Death has real consequences: lose ALL items/equipment + lose 1 life.
- Success (return alive) preserves all progress with no penalty.
- Risk assessment becomes critical: "Can I push deeper or should I return safely?"

**Death Penalty Details:**

| Lost on Death              | Gained on Death                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| All owned items            | 100% of soul remnants earned   |
| All equipped items         | (Souls are saved to total)     |
| Items brought from Base    |                                |
| 1 Life                     |                                |

> **Note:** The game allows unlimited exploration attempts. The tension comes from the permanent loss of items/equipment on death, not from limited exploration counts.

## 2. Map Structure Specifications

### 2.1 Concrete Hourglass Design

**Map Width and Rows per Depth**

| Depth | Theme   | Columns | Rows | Total Nodes (Approx) | Notes                             |
| ----- | ------- | ------- | ---- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1     | Decay   | 3-4     | 7    | 21-28                | Intro, moderate choices           |
| 2     | Madness | 4-5     | 7    | 28-35                | Choices begin to increase         |
| 3     | Chaos   | **5-6** | 7    | 35-42                | **Max Width**, highest freedom    |
| 4     | Void    | 3-4     | 7    | 21-28                | Rapid convergence, choices vanish |
| 5     | Abyss   | 1-2     | 7    | 7-14                 | Almost linear, no escape          |

**Player Choices:**

- Average 5-7 node selections per layer (Base is 7 rows = 7 selections).
- Horizontal movement is possible; taking detours can result in 8-10 selections.
- Shortest route takes about 5 nodes to reach the next layer.

**Visual Image of Map Shape:**

```text
      [Base Camp]          ← Base (Safe Zone)
          │
    ┌───┼───┐
   [ Depth 1 ]            ← 3-4 Cols (Narrow)
    │ │ │ │
  ┌─┴─┼─┼─┴─┐
 [ Depth 2 ]              ← 4-5 Cols (Expanding)
  │ │ │ │ │
 ┌┴─┼─┼─┼─┴┐
[ Depth 3 ]               ← 5-6 Cols (Max Width)
 │ │ │ │ │
  └─┬─┼─┬─┘
   [ Depth 4 ]            ← 3-4 Cols (Rapid Shrink)
    │ │ │
     └┬┘
   [ Depth 5 ]            ← 1-2 Cols (Linear)
      │
   [Boss / Abyss]

```

### 2.2 Node Connection Rules

**Vertical (Descending):**

- Each node connects to **1-3 nodes** in the row below.
- Depth 5 has minimal connections (1-2 nodes).

**Horizontal (Detour):**

- Can move to **adjacent nodes** within the same row (Depth 1-4 only).
- Horizontal movement counts as a node selection (no extra cost).
- Events/Combats occur normally on horizontally visited nodes.
- Horizontal movement is disabled in Depth 5 (due to linear path).

**Visual Representation:**

- Vertical Route: Thick solid line.
- Horizontal Route: Thin dotted line (Suggesting a "detour").

### 2.3 Node Appearance Ratios

**Ratio of Enemy/Event/Rest per Layer**

| Depth | Combat | Event | Rest | Notes                             |
| ----- | ------ | ----- | ---- | --------------------------------- |
| 1     | 50%    | 30%   | 20%  | Base. High rest for easier intro  |
| 2     | 55%    | 30%   | 15%  | Combat increases slightly         |
| 3     | 60%    | 30%   | 10%  | Combat becomes dominant           |
| 4     | 65%    | 30%   | 5%   | Almost no rest, harsh environment |
| 5     | 70%    | 25%   | 5%   | Combat focused, fewer events      |

**Event Content Breakdown:**

- **30-40% of Event Nodes contain Rest elements.**
- Rest Choice: Select either **AP Recovery** or **HP Recovery**.
- Example: "Found a cave. Rest? (Recover HP or Recover AP)"

- Alternative rewards for not choosing rest are not implemented at this stage.

**Placement Logic:**

- At least one "Non-Combat Node" per row (prevents complete dead ends).
- At least one Rest Node in the row immediately preceding a Boss (Preparation opportunity).

### 2.4 Map Generation Constraints

```typescript
interface MapGenerationConstraints {
  // Basic Constraints
  minNonCombatPerRow: 1; // Min 1 non-combat node per row
  maxConsecutiveCombat: 3; // Max consecutive combat nodes
  bossPreparationGuarantee: true; // Guaranteed rest before Boss

  // Special Nodes
  hiddenRoomPossibility: boolean; // Flag for hidden room generation
  shortcutPaths: number; // Number of shortcut routes (Depth 3 only)

  // Isolated Node Validation
  validateConnectivity: true; // Verify/fix unreachable or dead-end nodes
}
```

## 3. Node Information Disclosure Rules

### 3.1 Disclosure Stages

| State                     | Combat Node                         | Event Node                        | Rest Node            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Far (Unconnected)**     | Sword Icon                          | Event Icon (Suggests Risk/Reward) | Campfire Icon        |
| **Adjacent (Selectable)** | Sword Icon                          | Event Icon                        | Campfire Icon        |
| **Adjacent + Hover**      | Enemy Name, Threat, Drop Prediction | Event Name (If Known)             | Est. Recovery Amount |

### 3.2 Enemy Threat Level System

| Threat | Display Name | Corresponding Enemy Category           |
| ------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 1      | Minion (Low) | Normal Enemy (Weak)                    |
| 2      | Minion (Mid) | Normal Enemy (Strong)                  |
| 3      | Elite        | Elite Enemy                            |
| 4      | Floor Boss   | Floor Boss of each Depth               |
| 5      | Abyss Boss   | Depth 5 Boss (Guardian, True Evil God) |

> **Note:** Threat classification is an initial definition; details will be adjusted in `overroll_enemy_design.md`.

### 3.3 Definition of "Known" Events

**Conditions for an event to become Known:**

1. Event encountered at least once in past explorations.
2. Data is **reset on game over** (only achievements persist after game over).
3. All events are "?" on the very first play.

**Display of Known Events:**

- Icon: Suggests event type (Risk High/Low, Reward High/Low).
- Hover: Displays Event Name only (Choice details hidden).

**Display of First-Time Events:**

- Icon: "?"
- Hover: "Unknown Event"

> **Note:** Scout items/skills are under consideration. Implementation priority is low.

## 5. Return System UI

### 5.1 Return Modal Display

**Trigger:** Click Return Button.

**Modal Window:**

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Confirm Return Route       │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│ To Base: 18 Nodes                   │

```

### 5.2 Detailed Route Display

**On clicking "Show Route":**

- Modal closes.
- **Planned Return Route** is highlighted in yellow on the map.
- "Encounter Rate" (%) is displayed on each node.

**Visual Example:**

```text
  [Base]
    ↑ 10%
   ○ ← Low Risk
    ↑ 25%
   ○
    ↑ 45%
   ● ← Current Loc (High Risk)

```

### 5.3 Enemy Spawn Rules During Return

| Item            | Specification                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Enemy Strength  | **70% HP/ATK** (V3.0: Weakened) |
| Rewards         | **50%** (Gold, Stones, Souls)   |
| Card Mastery    | **Increases normally**          |
| Elite Enemies   | **Do not respawn**              |
| Bosses          | **Do not respawn**              |
| Enemy Type      | Same type as defeated enemies   |
| Encounter Check | Performed individually per room |

### 5.4 Process After Starting Return

**Return on Foot:**

1. Automatically move backward along the route one node at a time.
2. "Encounter Check" at each node.
3. Player control only occurs when combat starts (Transition to normal battle screen).
4. Auto-return resumes after battle.
5. Exploration ends upon reaching Base.

**Use Teleport Stone:**

- Immediate return to Base.
- No combat, no consumption.
- Consumes 1 Teleport Stone.
- **100% resource carry-back** (No reward reduction - unified stone type).

### 5.5 Escape Route (Depth 5 Boss Defeat) - V3.0

**Trigger:** Defeating the Depth 5 (Abyss) Boss.

**Escape Route Specifications:**

| Item            | Specification                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Appearance      | After boss defeat               |
| Combat          | **None** (Safe passage)         |
| Rewards         | **100%** (Full carry-back)      |
| Route Length    | Direct path to Base             |

**Process:**

1. Boss defeated → Victory screen displayed.
2. "Escape Route Opened" notification.
3. Player can choose to use the escape route.
4. Safe return to Base with all rewards.

> **Note:** The escape route is the only safe way to return from Depth 5 after boss defeat. Regular return routes from Depth 5 are extremely dangerous.

---

## 6. Theme Expression by Layer (Simplified)

### 6.1 Visual Implementation

Eliminate excessive effects; differentiate via color tone, background, and icon design.

| Depth | Background Color | Saturation     | Node Icon                       | Connection Line        | Notes                        |
| ----- | ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1     | Brown tones      | Med            | Normal size, slightly worn      | Solid, cracked texture | Decay image                  |
| 2     | Purple tones     | High           | Slightly irregular shapes       | Solid, slightly wavy   | Suggestion of Madness        |
| 3     | Dark Red/Violet  | Very High      | Mixed designs                   | Complex mesh/web       | Chaos, visual pressure       |
| 4     | Grey/White       | Very Low       | Semi-transparent, thin outlines | Dotted, fading         | Void, loss of info           |
| 5     | Pure Black       | 0 (Monochrome) | White points only               | Thin white lines       | Abyss, simple & intimidating |

### 6.2 Dynamic Change Effects

**Progress Indicator:**

- Displayed in Header.
- Visually shows distance from current location to Base.
- Bar decreases as you go deeper.

**Lives Warning Display:**

- 2 lives remaining: Lives icons pulse slightly.
- 1 life remaining: Last heart icon pulses red, header turns pale red, warning icon appears.

## 8. Technical Specification Notes

### 8.1 Proposed Data Structure

**Map Node:**

```typescript
interface MapNode {
  id: string;
  depth: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;
  column: number; // 0-5 (Column position)
  row: number; // 0-6 (Row position)
  type: "combat" | "event" | "rest";
  content: CombatData | EventData | RestData;
  isKnown: boolean; // Event known flag
  connections: string[]; // Connected Node ID array
  threatLevel?: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5; // Combat nodes only
}

interface CombatData {
  enemyId: string;
  enemyName: string;
  threatLevel: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;
  expectedDrops: DropItem[];
}

interface EventData {
  eventId: string;
  eventName: string;
  riskLevel: "low" | "medium" | "high";
  rewardLevel: "low" | "medium" | "high";
  hasRestOption: boolean;
}

interface RestData {
  recoveryType: "hp" | "ap" | "choice";
  estimatedRecovery: number;
}
```

**Exploration State:**

```typescript
interface ExplorationState {
  currentNodeId: string;
  visitedNodes: string[];
  currentDepth: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;
  playerStatus: PlayerStatus;
  knownEvents: string[]; // Reset on game over (only achievements persist)
}

interface LivesSystem {
  current: number;           // Current lives remaining
  max: number;               // Lives cap (2 for Hard, 3 for Normal/Easy)
  decreaseOnDeath: true;     // Lives decrease only on death
  decreaseOnReturn: false;   // Lives do NOT decrease on successful return
  recoveryMechanism: null;   // No recovery mechanism
}
```

### 8.2 Map Generation Algorithm Overview

1. Determine number of columns based on rows (7) for each Depth.
2. Randomly assign types (Combat/Event/Rest) to nodes based on ratios.
3. **Constraint Check**:

- Max consecutive combat nodes <= 3?
- At least 1 non-combat node per row?
- Rest node exists in row before Boss?
